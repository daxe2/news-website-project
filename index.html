	<h1>Arvind Kejriwal slams PM Modi, asks 5 questions to <br>RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat</h1>
     <p>Arvind Kejriwal said that he resigned because he was hurt by the corruption allegations against him</p>
     <p>Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and questioned the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) if it agreed with the Bharatiya Janata Party's politics of “using central agencies to break up parties and topple opposition governments.”
<br><br>
Kejriwal, during his first ‘Janata Ki Adalat’ public meeting after resigning as chief minister, asked five questions to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. 
<br><br>
“With all due respect, I want to ask Mohan Bhagwat ji five questions- the way Modi ji is breaking parties and bringing down governments across the country by luring them or threatening them with ED and CBI, is this correct?; Modi ji has included the most corrupt leaders in his party, whom he himself called corrupt, do you agree with such politics?” Kejriwal said at Jantar Mantar.
<br><br>
“BJP was born from the womb of RSS, it is the responsibility of RSS to ensure that BJP does not go astray, have you ever stopped Modi ji from doing wrong things?; JP Nadda said during the Lok Sabha elections that he does not need RSS. Has the son grown so much that he has started showing his displeasure?” </p>

<p>In an interview, Nadda had said,"Shuru mein hum aksham honge, thora kum honge, RSS ki zaroorat padti thi… Aaj hum badh gaye hain, saksham hai… toh BJP apne aap ko chalati hai (In the beginning, we would have been less capable, smaller and needed the RSS. Today, we have grown and we are capable. The BJP runs itself). That’s the difference."

“The son is showing his displeasure to the motherly institution. Didn't you feel sad when he said this?; You people have made a law that leaders will retire after 75 years... Amit Shah is saying that this rule will not apply to Modi ji. What applied to Advani ji, why will it not apply to Modi ji?” Kejriwal further asked.</p></div>

	<p>Police in Odisha’s Dhenkanal district detained four people on Sunday for allegedly raping a 22-year-old woman for months at an abandoned house where she and her “mentally unstable” father had been living for the last a few years, officers said.
<br>
According to police sources, the woman is now seven months pregnant. Police and local administration rescued her on Saturday, and she is now under the care of a district centre that provides services to women and children who are victims of violence.
<br><br>
Officials said the woman and her father had been living in the abandoned house due to their poor financial background. The woman’s mother died years ago and her father is mentally unstable, sources said.

Based on the victim’s complaint, police on Sunday registered a case and detained four people. “We are cross verifying the statement of the victim… All necessary processes are being followed in the case,” a senior police officer said.
<br><br>
A DSP-rank officer has been assigned to head the investigation in the case, and the SP is directly monitoring the case, police sources said.
<br><br>
Expressing concern over the incident, Deputy Chief Minister Pravati Parida said in a post on X that she had spoken to the Dhenkanal SP and directed that stringent action be taken against the culprits.
<br><br>
A senior district administration official said the victim was being provided with counselling and all necessary medical care. The official said steps were being taken to also provide care for her father.</p>

<p>Madhya Pradesh police have arrested a man who allegedly filmed the rape of a woman on a busy footpath in Ujjain district, police said Saturday. Superintendent of Police, Ujjain, Pradeep Sharma said that the accused, Mohammad Salim, 42, is an autorickshaw driver.
<br><br>
Sharma said that after the incident came to light, district police, cyber and social media teams were “deployed to find out who made the video of the incident and made it viral”.
<br><br>
“Within a few hours, the teams identified the accused who made the video. The accused has also been found to have a previous criminal record,” Sharma said.
<br><br>
Sharma said questioning of the accused was underway. The mobile phone of the accused is being examined, he said.
<br>
Police have booked Salim under Sections 72 (disclosure of identity of victim of certain offences), 77 (whoever watches, or captures the image of a woman engaging in a private act…), 294 (sale of obscene content) of the BNS, Section 67 of the IT Act and Section 4 of Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act.

According to police,<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/woman-raped-footpath-video-madhya-pradesh-ujjain-congress-bjp-9553355/"> the woman was raped on a footpath</a>in Koyla Phatak, one of the busiest intersections, on Wednesday. The incident was shot by a passerby and several people saw the incident, yet nobody intervened, police said.
<br><br>
The police said the woman, in her complaint, named the accused as Lokesh, who was arrested within two hours of registering the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/fir-cognizable-offence-ipc-explained-7780266/">FIR</a>. Lokesh allegedly promised to marry the woman, made her drink liquor and then raped her, police said.
<br><br>
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav meanwhile promised strict action in the case and accused the opposition of doing politics on the crime but keeping mum on the Kolkata rape-murder. The opposition has slammed the BJP government in MP claiming that it has failed to protect women. Asked about the Ujjain incident, Yadav told PTI in Ujjain that there is a rule of law in Madhya Pradesh and the government will deal strictly with whoever commits a crime.
<br><br>
“No one will be spared. Be it Ujjain or (anywhere in) the state, we are committed to good governance under the leadership of the Prime Minister,” he said. Ujjain is the hometown of Yadav, who also holds the portfolio of home ministry. He said, “Those who are doing politics should look into their own affairs. It will be understandable if they take care of the states ruled by them. They do not open their mouths on the incident in Kolkata (rape-murder of a trainee doctor).”</p>
